Procrastinator
======================

Why do now what you could put off for later?

Procrastinator is a simple queue built with Node.js. It asynchronously queues 
messages for some time, and calls a webhook when time's up. 

Like a good procrastinator. It doesn't perform any actual work. It just puts it off for later.
