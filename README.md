Procrastinator
======================

Procrastinator is a simple delay queue built with Node.js. It asynchronously queues 
messages for some time, and calls a webhook when time's up. 

It doesn't perform any actual work. It just puts it off for later.


## Requirements

All the requirements are available via NPM.

- **winston**  Logging.
- **journey**  Routing for the API.
- **optimist** Option parsing.
- **hashlib**  SHA1 id's.
- **vows**     Running tests.
